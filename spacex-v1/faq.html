      <h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>


     
      <h3><em>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</em></h3>

      <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but won't be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can throw about 16000 kg on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so it can send a Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin.</p>
      <p>However, in order to land on surface you need to slow down from orbit velocity, which requires change in velocity by a certain amount. Dragon 2 carries only a small amount of propellant and can only deliver a small amount of velocity change, therefore.</p>
      <p>The exact amount is less than 500m/s, which does not come close to the ~1870m/s needed to land on the moon. It may be possible to do it with two FH launches but that would require additional technologies.</p>
      
      
      <h3><em>What is Red Dragon?</em></h3>

      <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martion surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the heaviest object ever placed on Mars - it alone could carry an additional 2 metric tons of cargo and equipment down to the surface.</p>
      <p>There have been no official announcements about the mission from SpaceX as the mission design architecture is not managed by them and there is currently no indication that the project will be funded.</p>
     
      <h3><em>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</em></h3>

      <p>No. Dragon is too cramped, and would need significant improvments in the life support system to last throughout the long journey. Elon Must himself has stated that Dragon 2 can support 7 astronauts for "several days".</p>

      <h3><em>Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</em></h3>

      <p>The current version of the Dragon physically cannot dock, and only berth. This is because it has a common berthing mechanism port and not a NASA docking system port. The advantages of this is that its 50 inches in diameter, whereas Nasa system is only 31 inches wide. 
        The disadvatages of berthing is that its a tedious process whereby astronauts carefully maneuver the capsule into place using canadarms, then physically bolt the ports together. To unberth, the reverse must occure. Docking by contrast is autonomous and much faster in both directions. </p>

<h3><em>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the ISS?</em></h3>

<p>
The Dragon 1 would be a very poor lifeboat for the ISS. The Dragon does not dock, so it must berth to ISS. Berthing is a tedious process whereby astronauts manuver the capsule. There are two soyuzes attached to the station that always there and ready to at moments notice, so its difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd have to evacuate using the Dragon as escape pod. I addition, on top of providing a slow evacuation, the dragon is only there for a month at a time, once every 6 months and has no seats and is likely to be filled with cargo.
</p>

<h3><em>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the ISS?</em></h3>
     
<p>
  In all likelihood, no. There are lots of reasons why this would not work. Dragon does not carry enough fueltp reboost the station. The SuperDraco engines are too powerful, the docking ports the Dragon uses are unable to. handle the forces.
  The dragon would not be firing through the stations center of mass, and the dragon does not have the needed connections to guide the station.
</p>

<h3><em>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</em></h3>

<p>According to Has Koenigsmann at the dragon pad abort press conference, the dragon 2 weighs 21000lbs , 3500lbs of which is propellant. Assuming the suoerdracos have a specific impulse of 235s, that means the total delta v of dragon 2 is 420m/s</p>

<h3><em>What would happen if one of the dragons 2s superdraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</em></h3>

<p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight superdraco thrusters without any problems</p>

<h3><em>Will superDraco replace Draco?</em></h3>

<p>
  No they won't. Both are designed for entirely different applications. Draco engines have thrust of 400N aand are used for in-ordit manouvering. SuperDraco engines produce 73000N thrust and are used for out-of orbit stuff.
</p>

<h3><em>What is PICA-X?Does PICA-X ablate?</em></h3>

<p>PICA stands for Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator and yes it does. It was the material used to coat the stardust capsule that returned to earth from interplanetery velocities in 2006, and was patented by NASA in the 1990s for uses on the mission asno other heatsheild material would be able to withstand the extreme heat and speeds that the misssion heatsheild would require to have. Albatibe sheilds work by letting small amounts of the heatsheild to evaporate in the extreme heat of reentry. </p>
