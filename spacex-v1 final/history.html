      <h2>Dragon Spacecraft Development</h2>
      <p>
        SpaceX began developing the dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009.
        Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the International Space Station for the American federal space agency, NASA.

        During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit . 
        On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the ISS.
        SpaceX is contracted to deliver cargo to ISS under NASA's Commercial resupply services program, and Dragon began regualr flights in October 2012.
        With the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK cygnus, Nasa seeks to increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.

        On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission in September 2014 was
         launched again for the first time, with the hull, structural elements, thrusters, harnesses, propellants tanks, plumbing, and many of the avionics reused while the heat sheild, batteries, and components exposed to the seat water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.
