<h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</br></h2> 
web accessibility is about fostering inclusivity, complying with legal requirements, expanding business opportunities, enhancing user experiences, and being socially responsible. It ensures that the internet remains a place where all individuals, regardless of their abilities, can access information, products, and services on an equal footing. It's not just a best practice; it's a fundamental principle of a fair and accessible digital society
